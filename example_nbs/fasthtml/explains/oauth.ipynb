    "OAuth is an open standard for 'access delegation', commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. It is the mechanism that enables \"Log in with Google\" on many sites, saving you from having to remember and manage yet another password. Like many auth-related topics, there's a lot of depth and complexity to the OAuth standard, but once you understand the basic usage it can be a very convenient alternative to managing your own user accounts."
