## How to use

Call a Jupyter notebook with the `nb2classic.core.render_nb` function. It will convert the notebook into FT Components. You will need to have the `MarkdownJS()` and `HighlightJS()` set in the FastHTML hdrs.

Here's an example that uses `demo.ipynb`, which is in the root of this project.

``` python
from nb2fasthtml.core import *
from fasthtml.common import *

hdrs = [
    MarkdownJS(),
    HighlightJS(langs=['python', 'javascript', 'html', 'css',]),    
]

app, rt = fast_app(hdrs=hdrs)

@rt
def index():
    return render_nb('demo.ipynb')

serve()
```

The `render_nb()` function can be configured to work with other layout libraries such as fh-frankenui.
